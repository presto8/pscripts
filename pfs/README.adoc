= pfs

Helper to manage filesystems, in particular ZFS and MergerFS storage devices.

Each system has a configuration for its storage devices in /etc/pfs.conf.
pfs.conf lists the desired mountpoints and any components needed. For ZFS
filesystems, pfs manages properties and snapshots.

Work in progress. Not ready for use yet.
